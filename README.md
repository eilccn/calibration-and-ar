# Calibration and Augmented Reality

## Project Description
For this project we implemented a program that can calibrate a camera and then use the calibration data in order to generate virtual objects in a scene. The final program has the ability to detect a target point and then place a virtual object in the scene relative to the target. As a result, the virtual object will be capable of orienting itself according to the location and movements of the camera (or target). In this specific implementation we are using a 9x6 checkerboard checkerboard.png  as a target and means of camera calibration. 

## Instructions for running executables:
1. Place all .cpp and .h files along with a CMakeLists.txt file into a directory (i.e. called "project4")
2. Open "project4" in Visual Studio Code
3. Build "project4" using the "CMake Tools" extension
4. Run the program by entering "./project4"
